##Exercise #1: Love

Close your eyes. Take a breath. Inhale. Exhale. No thoughts. 
Now a word: “love”. How do you feel? What do you see?

##Exercise #2: Fear

Close your eyes. Take a breath. Inhale. Exhale. No thoughts. 
Now a word: “fear”. How do you feel? What do you see?

##Exercise #3: Synonyms + Antonyms

For each of these words, love + fear, there is a set of related words that can evoke similar or opposite feelings + experiences, we call these words synonyms + antonyms.

Close your eyes. Take a breath. Inhale. Exhale. No thoughts.

Now imagine all the words that are related to love -- in your mind -- not some dictionary. 

Words that are similar to love, words that are dissimilar.

Now do the same thing with fear -- in your mind -- not some dictionary. 

Words that are similar to fear, words that are dissimilar.

How do you feel when you think about each word? What do you see in your mind’s eye?

##Exercise #4: Social Programming

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of love + fear social programming in the 2016 United States election between the two leading candidates running for that role.

We will examine this programming by looking at the words spoken by these candidates at recent campaign events.

Our goal is to determine how they used love + fear words (and thus feelings + experiences) with their followers.

Make a good choice in November, the world is watching.
